# How to push your repository to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter "book_summary" as the repository name
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Add the remote repository URL to your local repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/book_summary.git
   ```
   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   Or if you renamed your branch to main:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted

Your code is now on GitHub!

# Optional: Rename the default branch from 'master' to 'main'
If you prefer to use 'main' instead of 'master' as your default branch name:

1. Rename the branch locally:
   ```
   git branch -m master main
   ```

2. Push the renamed branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Set the default branch on GitHub:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Click on "Branches"
   - Change the default branch to "main"
   - Click "Update"
